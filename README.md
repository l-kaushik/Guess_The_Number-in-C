# Getting Started

## About Files
* The only difference between both "Guess_Vs.C" and "Guess_Turbo.C" is that, in file "Guess_Turbo.C", added clrscr(); and getch(); for clearing previous output and pausing the screen to see the output.

## Dependencies
* If you are going to use vs code IDE, then download Guess_Vs.C.
* And if you are going to use Turbo C/C++ IDE, then download Guess_Turbo.C.
* I have not tried it in other IDEs, so not sure about them, but Guess_Vs.C will work fine.

## Keep in mind
* This program can still stuck in an infinte loop, if user input character instead of numbers. But to prevent that I have use "fflush(stdin);" to clear the input buffer.

## Installing
* Just simply download the file according to your need as explained above.
